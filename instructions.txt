Hi, welcome!

To start the app, just run the command bottom:
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:run

Or, if you prefer, you can apply the maven commands to create the build package:
$ ./mvnw clean
$ ./mvnw install
$ java -jar target/sample-forum-app-0.0.1.war

The app will run at this address -> http://localhost:8080

To access the app, use the following logins:
user: admin
password: admin
user: sergio
password: sergio123

Have fun! :-)
